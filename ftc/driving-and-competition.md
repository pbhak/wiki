# Driving and Competition

## For Drivers

* **Communication is key.**
  * For effective communication, you need to listen to both your coach and your fellow driver.
  * Also, before competition matches, good communication with your alliance partner is extremely important.
    * This way, you guys can have a set strategy the second you go into the queuing area and all you have to do is clear up a few last minute things, not having to fumble at the last minute to try and get a strategy together
<br>

* **Get practice: LOTS of practice.**
  * The more you can practice, the better you can drive and the better you do at competitions.
<br>

* **Don’t trash talk.**
  * Always try to maintain gracious professionalism even when you lose.
  * Don’t trash talk each other either.
<br>

* **Make sure you talk to your team after matches.**
  * Congratulate them on what happened, clear up anything that needs to be cleared up
  * Don't forget to leave the field though!
<br>

* **Be on time and ready.**
  * Sometimes you can get really unlucky with back-to-back matches, but just try your best.
<br>

* **Have a few team members taking notes during matches**
  * This helps to know what you're up against and can also help for picking your alliance partner
  * Make sure they check in with the rest of the team frequently to go over notes
